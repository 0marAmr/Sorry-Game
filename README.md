# Sorry-Game!

>### Game Rules:
- Each player has 4 pawns.
- If it's your first turn and you do not draw a card that lets you start a pawn out, you forfeit(skip) your turn.
- To move a pawn from your start out onto the track, you must draw either a 1 or a 2. If it is a 2 put a pawn on the main track if it was on start and draw again. Otherwise, move pawn forward 2 steps and draw again.
- You may jump over your own or another player's pawn that's in your way, counting it as one space. BUT... if you land on a space that's already occupied by an opponent's pawn, BUMP that pawn back to its own START space.
- Two pawns of the same color may never occupy the same space. If your only possible move would make you land on a space already occupied by another of your own pawns, you forfeit your turn.
- If at any time you cannot move, you forfeit your turn.
- But if at any time you can move, you must move, even if it's to your disadvantage.
- If the pawn is placed on (>), it will move either 3 or 4 steps foward (Clarified which is which on the board) on the main track bumping any opponent's pawn/s back to its/their own START space.
- Movement of pawns is in clockwise movement.
- If the drawn card was (0), then the player can choose any opponent's pawn on the main to replace its own and bump the opponet's pawn back to start.
